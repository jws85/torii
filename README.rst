torii is a small script that uses `Jinja2 <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/>`_
to apply the values in a JSON file to a template file, and emits the output on
stdout.

I first wrote a version of torii to add some per-machine configurability to my
`i3 <https://i3wm.org/>`_ configuration, but it seems like it would be useful
to have a utility that adds some configurability to otherwise static files...
